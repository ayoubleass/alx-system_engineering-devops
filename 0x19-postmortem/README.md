Postmortem
Learning How to Write an Incident Report: A Comprehensive Guide

Incident reports, also known as postmortems, are essential documents used to analyze and document significant events or incidents within an organization's systems or operations. This guide follows closely the guidelines used by Google engineers to file reports and is structured into five key parts: issue summary, timeline, root cause analysis, resolution and recovery, and corrective and preventative measures. Let's review each of these parts in detail.

Issue Summary:

A brief summary of the incident (5 sentences or less).
Duration of the incident, including start and end times (with timezone).
Statement of the impact (e.g., most user requests resulted in 500 errors, at peak 100%).
Conclusion with the identified root cause.
Timeline:

Timezone specified for clarity.
Coverage of the outage duration, from start to end.
Events listed chronologically, including when the outage began, when staff was notified, actions taken, and when service was restored.
Root Cause:

Detailed explanation of the event, without sugarcoating.
Comprehensive analysis of the underlying causes or contributing factors that led to the incident.
Resolution and Recovery:

Detailed explanation of the actions taken to resolve the incident, including timestamps.
Clear description of the steps taken to restore service and recover from the outage.
Corrective and Preventative Measures:

Itemized list of actionable steps to prevent similar incidents in the future.
Reflection on what can be improved or done better next time.
